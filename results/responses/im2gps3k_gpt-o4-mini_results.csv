The architectural style—eclectic historicist with neo-Renaissance elements—is characteristic of late 19th‐century civic monuments in Hungary. City: I chose Budapest because this style and scale of castle‐like structure are found in Budapest’s City Park (Városliget), a well‐known area with grand exhibition buildings. Neighborhood: I selected Városliget (City Park) because the building sits in a landscaped park setting with paved walkways and tourist information kiosks, matching the layout around Vajdahunyad Castle in Budapest’s main city park. Exact location: I identified the building as Vajdahunyad Castle (Vajdahunyadvár) in City Park, Budapest, due to the distinctive tower silhouette on the right and the ornate entrance wing with flags, which correspond precisely to photographs of the castle’s entrance courtyard."",
