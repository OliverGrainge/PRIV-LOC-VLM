I therefore select the Yaldhurst/West Melton fringe as the neighbourhood. \nExact location name: State Highway 73 (Great Alpine Highway) just west of Yaldhurst, near West Melton, is a well-known stretch that looks almost identical to the photographed scene—single carriageway, white posts, a right-turn bay taper, and the Alps visible ahead. \nCoordinates: A pinpoint along SH-73 at the intersection with Weedons Ross Road (a common right-turn bay location) sits at approximately –43.4910 latitude, 172.4330 longitude, which fits the visual clues."",
