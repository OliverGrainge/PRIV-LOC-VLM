### Reasoning:
1. **Country**: The Netherlands is chosen because the image strongly resembles the traditional Dutch Carnaval celebrations. The costumes, makeup, and festive atmosphere align with the cultural practices seen during Carnaval, which is a major annual event in the Netherlands.
   
2. **City**: Maastricht is selected because it is one of the cities in the Netherlands known for its vibrant Carnaval celebrations. Maastricht's Carnaval is particularly famous for its elaborate parades and costumes, making it a likely candidate.

3. **Neighborhood**: The Centrum (center) area of Maastricht is typically where major public events like parades take place. It is the heart of the city and would naturally host such festivities.

4. **Exact Location Name**: The ""Carnaval Parade Route"" is a reasonable guess since the image shows participants on a float, which is characteristic of parade routes during Carnaval.

5. **Latitude and Longitude**: These coordinates correspond to the central area of Maastricht, where such events are most likely to occur."

The presence of large inflatable skeletons, colorful decorations, and the overall festive atmosphere strongly suggest this event is taking place in a region with significant Mexican influence.

### Reasoning:
1. **Country**: The ""Day of the Dead"" celebration is deeply rooted in Mexican culture but is widely celebrated in Mexican-American communities in the United States. The costumes, decorations, and overall theme strongly indicate a location where this tradition is prominent, making the United States the most logical choice.

2. **City**: Los Angeles is known for its large Mexican-American population and vibrant cultural celebrations, including the ""Day of the Dead."" The city hosts numerous parades and festivals that reflect its diverse cultural heritage, making it a prime candidate for such an event.

3. **Neighborhood**: East Los Angeles is a historically significant area with a strong Mexican-American community. It is known for hosting large-scale cultural events and parades, often centered around traditions like the ""Day of the Dead.""

4. **Exact Location**: Hollenbeck Park is a central location in East Los Angeles, frequently used for community events, parades, and cultural gatherings. Its open space and accessibility make it an ideal venue for the type of parade depicted in the image. Additionally, the park's proximity to other cultural landmarks in the area further supports this choice."
